# Arc_Reactor_app
Splunk app with default datamodels and dashboards for Windows Events, Sysmon, and Zeek logs. Also includes a MITRE ATTACK Framework incident management dashboard and other helpful views.

Home Page: The Home overview is to be utilzed for verified incidents that are framed and categorized by the MITRE ATTACK Framework. Inputing incidents are completed under the Home tab - Annolyst Annotations dashboard. Dependencies for this dashboard are analyst_annotations.csv and mitre_attack_framework.csv lookup files.

Home - Network Monitoring: Network Monitoring will show all network injested data and quick visualizations.

Home -Network Map is to show a visual representation of the network that is being monitored. There are 3 example lookup table files (Network Map, Network Map2, Frothly) that are currently in the dashboard as examples. Dependencies for this dashboard are the lookup file for the Network Map and Network Diagram Viz app.

Home - Analyst Annotation Maker is used to feed information to the Home overview page. A useful but not dependant app to have is the Lookup Editor App.

Home - Analyst Viewer will show all events logged by analyst's from the Analyst Annotation maker tab.

Host - Sysmon Overview dashboard is useful to see highlights of injested data. As seen in the bottom left and bottom right panels, All clickable events (Computer Clickable and User Clickable) will be identified and pushed to the correct drilldown.

Host - TSTATS Sysmon is a replica of the TSTATS overview. In terms of speed, TSTATS dashboards will be much faster. No TSTATS dashboards have objects that are clickable to drilldowns.

Host - Windows Events Summary Dashboard example:

Network - Zeek - Zeek SSL and X509 example: Dependencies for this dashboard are for the Ja3 Panels that utilze the ja3_json indexed data. The ja3_json data will need to be updated regularly.

Network - Easy IP search. This dashboard gives the user the ability to see and IP as a source or desinitation IP and a quick glance at attributes.

Drilldowns are seperated into Host ie Sysmon and Windows events or Zeek. Host example below.
