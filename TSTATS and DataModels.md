DataModels run TSTATS dashboards! This is all you need to know.

Below shows the 6 DataModels taken from the Splunk CIM App to accelerate the data. note from the picture Arc_Reactor_app and Created in App are chosen to show the datamodels used within the Arc Reactor App. The lightning Bold symbolizes the datamodel being accelerated. Within the picure; Network Data, suricata, and sysmon are accelerated.
